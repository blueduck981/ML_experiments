In these notebooks I use K-means clustering for Galactic Archaeology. My reference data is taken from Data Release 13 of the Apogee survey.  I run an initial exploratory analysis of the Apogee data in "apogee_ML."   In "apogee_ML-GCs" I use the Apogee clustering data to classify observations of extragalactic globular clusters into halo and disk populations.
